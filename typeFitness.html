        Cardiorespiratory Fitness
    </h3>
    <p id="first">
        Cardiorespiratory endurance tells us how well our body can act during physical activity via the body’s
        circulatory and respiratory systems. Activities that help improve cardiorespiratory endurance are those that
        cause an increase in heart rate for a determined time.
        These activities include:-
    <ul>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <li>Brisk Walking</li>
        <li>Exercising</li>
        <li> Cycling or Jogging</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p id="second">
        People who regularly take part in these activities are more likely to be physically fit in terms of
        cardiorespiratory endurance. It is important to begin these activities slowly and gradually increase the
        intensity.
        Cardiorespiratory fitness can help to reduce heart disease, lung cancer,
        Type 2 diabetes,etc.

        Muscular Strength
    </h3>
    <p id="first">
        Muscular strength can be defined as the ability of the muscle to exert force during an activity.
        In order to build or strengthen muscles, one must should exercise regularly and should consume enough
        protein to meet its requirement.
    </p>
    <p id="second">
        The exact mechanism of muscle building is not fully understood, but the general principles are well known.
        Training causes the muscle cells to expand and there is an increase in actin and myosin production.
        In general, if a muscle is worked consistently and regularly, it will increase in strength. There are
        various ways of putting your muscles through rigorous activity, but anything that works a muscle until it is
        tired will increase muscle strength over time.

        Endurance
    </h3>
    <p id="first">
        Fitness can include muscular endurance, which is the ability of a muscle to continue exerting force without
        tiring. As mentioned above, strength training builds bigger muscles. Endurance training, on the other hand,
        does not necessarily generate muscles of a larger size.
        This is because the body focuses more on the cardiovascular system, ensuring that the muscles receive the
        oxygenated blood they need to keep functioning. Another important change in muscles that are specifically
        trained for endurance concerns the different types of muscle tissue – fast twitch and slow twitch fibers.

        Body Composition
    </h3>
    <p id="first">
        Body composition measures the relative amounts of muscle, bone, water, and fat.
        An individual can potentially maintain the same weight but radically change the ratio of each of the
        components that make up the body.
        For instance, people with a high muscle (lean mass) ratio weigh more than those with the same height and
        waist circumference who have less muscle. Muscle weighs more than fat.

        Flexibility
    </h3>
    <p id="first">
        Flexibility is the range of movement across a joint. Flexibility is important because it improves the
        ability to link movements together smoothly and can help prevent injuries. Flexibility is specific to each
        joint and depends on a number of variables, including the tightness of ligaments and tendons.
        Flexibility is increased by various activities, all designed to stretch joints, ligaments, and tendons.
        There are a number of ways to improve flexibility. A daily stretching regimen can be the simplest and most
        efficient way of achieving whole body flexibility.
